| Logica de Programacao e Algoritmos I | This course covered thee baisic concepts of coding and algorithnics as for example: variables, data types, aritmetic and logical operators, conditional structures, loop structures, input and output data statments, random numbers and more. |
| Logica de Programacao e Algoritmos II | As far the basic concepts were explored in previous course, more complex knowledge started to be presented as for example vectors, matrixes, procedures, funcitions and a brief introduction to OOP - Object Oriented Programing paradigmn.    |
| Logica de Programacao e Algoritmos III | It is the best moment. Java language is the main plate of our dinner. Let's enjoy this opportunity! There is a project in this folder called javaExercises.                                                                                    |
| Lógica para Programação III - JAVA.pdf | The problems's descriptions are writen in prortuguese, in accordance with the oficial course language.                                                                                                                            |
